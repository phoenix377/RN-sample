This test have 2 implementations:
1) Using only hooks. (As app is simple now, this solution in my mind is the optimal one)
2) + Using MobX Store

Running app you'll see both versions on their respective tab.

## Run instructions for Android:
- Have an Android emulator running (quickest way to get started), or a device connected.
- cd "./unit_converter" && npx react-native run-android

## Run instructions for iOS:
- cd "./unit_converter" && npx react-native run-ios
- or -
- make sure pods are installed by running "cd ios && pod install"
- Open ./unit_converter/ios/TestApp.xcworkspace in Xcode or run "xed -b ios"
- Hit the Run button
